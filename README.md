# NorthwindNg
This Angular demonstration project was created using Visual Studio Code 1.48.21, Angular 10.0.8, and Node v14.5.0. The objective is to demonstrate Angular CRUD functionality against the NorthwindWebApi project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.  The --open (or just -o ) option opens your browser to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Demonstration
Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations are performed in the animated GIF below:
